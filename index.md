# CAU

### Center for Applied Utilitarianism

We are a London-based effective altruism think tank, working on discovering and curating the next generation of high-impact charities.

We're building **CAU Fund**, a crowdfunding website where people can discover and fund high-impact charitable projects.

In contrast to other charity evaluators which direct funds to established charities with considerable room for more funding, **CAU Fund** moves money to smaller, fledgling projects, especially in the research, policy and advocacy space.
